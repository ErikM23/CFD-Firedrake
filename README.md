# Firedrake
This project is part of the diploma thesis "Efficient solvers for incompressible flow problems".

The emphasis is on efficient preconditioning (PCD and LSC) for incompressible Navier-Stokes system. Especially, PCD preconditioning for time-dependent flow described by incompressible Navies-Stokes equations was implemented in Firedrake. The validation was performed on 2 benchmarks: lid-driven cavity and flow around the cylinder. Weak and strong scaling of used solvers were compared.
